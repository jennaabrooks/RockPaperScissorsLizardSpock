    "\n",
    "1. The user and computer choose one of the following weapons:\n",
    "    - Rock (in red)\n",
    "    - Paper (in yellow)\n",
    "    - Scissors (in purple)\n",
    "    - Lizard (puppet-like hand, in green)\n",
    "    - Spock (Vulcan salutation, in blue)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Here are the winning outcomes: \n",
    "    - Rock: Wins against Lizard or Scissors (crushes the Lizard and breaks the Scissor)\n",
    "    - Paper: Wins against Spock or Rock (disproves Spock and wraps the Rock)\n",
    "    - Scissors: Wins against Lizard and Paper (kills the Lizard or cuts the Paper)\n",
    "    - Lizard: Wins against Spock and Paper (poisons Spock or eats the Paper)\n",
    "    - Spock: Wins against Rock and Paper (vaporizes the Rock and smashes the Scissors)\n",
